As a Software Developer with extensive experience in Laravel, Vue js, and Nuxt.js, I specialize in building scalable, high-performance web applications. With a strong foundation in backend development using Laravel and dynamic frontend interfaces with Nuxt.js and Vue.js, I am passionate about crafting clean, efficient code that drives both user engagement and business success.

I have collaborated with clients throughout my career to understand their unique needs, providing technical solutions that meet their business goals. From RESTful API development to responsive UI design with Tailwind CSS, my approach is rooted in ensuring seamless, secure, and scalable applications. I am experienced in integrating third-party services, such as OpenAI, Stripe, and Jira, and I thrive in fast-paced, agile environments.

I’ve worked on exciting projects like BetterCases (AI-driven test case generation) and Nestor (audio transcription using OpenAI), where I led efforts in full-stack development, debugging, and performance optimization.

My technical toolkit includes MySQL, Postman, Swagger, Docker, and Git, and I continually push myself to explore new technologies such as Node.js and React.js.

I’m driven by continuous learning, teamwork, and a dedication to delivering high-quality software solutions. Let’s connect and see how I can bring value to your next project!
